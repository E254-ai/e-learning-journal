# e254-learning-journal

-a beginner diving into the world of tech, Python, and AI in 2025.  
This repository tracks my journey from Day 1 of learning to code, all the way through to building small projects and using real AI tools.

## 🔥 Why I'm Doing This
I believe tech is the future, and even though I started with zero experience, I have the fire to learn and grow every day. This repo is my accountability space and proof that you can start from scratch and still make magic happen.
